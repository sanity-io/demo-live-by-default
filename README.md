# Live by default - For framework and library authors

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the version for framework and library authors that shows how the API works under the hood, [there's also a version for app developers that focuses on real-world usage with higher-level abstractions](https://github.com/sanity-io/demo-live-by-default/tree/main#readme).
